         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Beloved, when ye lift up your eyes towards heaven in prayer, it ſhould note, that your heart is in heaven: I am ſure, with Chriſt it was thus, though with you it may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; It may be thine eye is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven in a prayer, when at the ſame time thine heart is towards thy ſhop, towards thine evil company, towards thy whores, or wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Remember O Man! to keep thine heart as well as thine eye toward heaven in prayer; let your hearts and your eyes be both towards the ſame place. Chriſt lift up his eyes to heaven in prayer, and his heart was there alſo, and ſo ſhould it be with you.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt prayed, <hi>O my father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Chriſt prayed to God his Father.</note> to teach you, that you muſt not only pray with an awful apprehencion of God,

<note place="margin">3. Chriſt prayes for his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement</note> Chriſt prayes with great enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good of his Diſciples. I doe not read in above 3. or 4. verſes, that Chriſt prayed for himſelf; all the reſt of the prayer was for his diſciples, that God would keep them in unity &amp; truth, and glorify them, and all other beleivers with himſelf in heaven. Here then behold the wonderful affection that Jeſus Chriſt beares unto his Church, and people, that when he was to die, he ſhould pray more for the ſaveing of their ſouls, then for the ſaveing of his own life, o! herein the ſuperabundant love of Jeſus Chriſt is manifeſted, who when he was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to die a painful, ſhameful,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170695:17"/>accurſed death, under going the wrath of God, due unto our ſins, yet that then he would remember his elect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in whoſe ſtead he ſtood, and for whoſe ſins he died, with ſuch enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Circumſtance conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this prayer of Chriſts is the matter, for what he prayed:
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Circu.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for what Chriſt prayed.</note> And that is layd down 2 wayes. 1. Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who ſhould not be the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his prayer, <hi>I pray not for the world. v.</hi> 9. This is a good argument againſt thoſe that plead for univerſal Redemption: If Ieſus Chriſt would not ſpend his breath to pray for them, then ſurely he would not ſpend his precious bloud to purchaſe heaven for them. Then it is layd down Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, whom he prayed for; <hi>I pray for them that thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> you that are elected, you that are regenerated, I pray for you. He makes many requeſts unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the behalfe of his Diſciples that God would keep them, <hi>that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170695:18"/>might be one with him, v.</hi> 11. That God would ſanctify them. <hi>v.</hi> 17. That they might come to heaven and be with Chriſt. <hi>v.</hi> 24. And (as in the text) <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil.</hi>

                     </note> It may be demanded why Chriſt ſayd theſe words, That he would not pray that his Diſciples might be taken out of the world.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt knew that his end was at hand,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170695:18"/>his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</hi> when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples heard this, they thought thus with themſelves, Lord if thou wilt leave this world, what will become of us when thou art gone, we ſhall be in the world as a ſhip without a Pilot as ſheep without a Shepard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prayed, that they might die with Chriſt; <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.16.

                     </note> Chriſt did not pray that the Diſciples might be taken out of the world, becauſe he had further work for them to do here in the world. As if he had ſayd, I have the Goſpel for you to divulge and propogate, ſouls for you to convert, mine Elect to gather in; therefore I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170695:19"/>will not pray the Father to take you out of the world, but to keepe you from the Evil of the world, though I will not pray to keep you from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of Afflictions, and Perſecutions which for my nameſake ye muſt expect to meet withal in the world; yet I will pray to keep you from the evil of ſin, that you fall not into ſin through the allurements or frownes of the world, the malicious temptations of Satan, the ſuggeſtions and inclinations of your own corrupt hearts, when I am gone; I will pray that my Father would keep you from the evil of the times and places in which you live.</p>

                     </note> The Souldier never growes famous for his vallour until he comes to bear the brunt of the Battel in the Field: And the Chriſtian never ſhines in grace, untill he comes into the fire of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170695:21"/>eſpecially if he ſuffer in bearing witneſſe unto the truth of Chriſt. Therefore we ſhould be content yea rejoyce in our ſufferings and not deſire death, to be rid of the troubles of this life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is not the deſire of Jeſus Chriſt that any of his ſervants ſhould die,

Sayes God to a Miniſter, thou ſhalt preach ſo many Sermons, convert ſo many ſouls, gather in ſo many of mine Elect; and when thy work is done, thy life ſhall be done. Thou
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170695:24"/>godly Chriſtian, untill thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thy work, thou ſhalt not end thy dayes.

                  <p>The Uſe of this is threefold; Firſt for Counſel, Secondly for Reproofe, Thirdly for Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Uſe of Councel unto you all:

Doe not deſire to live that you may give the ſwinge to your luſts, and doe that which is right in your owne eyes; But deſire to live no longer then that you may ſerve God, and doe good to others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhould teach you who may be uſeful in the world, that you are bound to deſire of God, that he would not as yet take you out of the world.

Any of you, who may bee uſefull in the world, are bound to begg of God, that hee would lengthen out your dayes, and that you may live to doe more good, in the place wherein God hath let you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Hence let me Counſel you, That though you ſuffer much evil from the world, yet if you can doe much good in the world, let your doing of good rather provoke you to deſire life, then your ſuffering of evil provoke you to deſire death.

There were many ſuch that lived in the time of the Prophets; that were men of dayes, yet infants in underſtanding, &amp; Knowledg. <hi>Nor ſhall there be an old man, that hath not filled his dayes.</hi> That is, the old man that doth not act grace, that doth not ſerve, and glorifie God, that doth not fullfill the duty of every day, that fills his daies with ſin, and not with righteouſneſſe; this is the man that hath not filled his daies. There are many ſuch old men in the world, whoſe wrinckled faces, and gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haires doe declare them to be four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of age, yet in regard of grace, and knowledge, they are not come to the age of 14 years. Now how may this juſtly be for rebuke to any of you, who are infants of daies, who have done God no more ſervice, and are no more acquainted with God, then Children, you have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170695:27"/>lived many daies, but they have bin emptie daies; your hearts are full of ſin, no marvell then that they are ſo emptie of grace. Is there not many a man &amp; woman, who may with ſhame and ſorrow thus reflect upon ſelfe before God:</p>
                  <p>Have not I lived to 40.60. nay it may be 80 years, yet Lord thou knoweſt, my daies are emptie daies, I have not done any good all my life time. In Scripture dialect, when good men die, they are ſaid to die in a good old age; But an old Drunkard, an old Adulterer, or an old Swearer, dieing in an old age, it is a bad old age, not a good old age. When you come to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, then Conſcience will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon you and ſay, I am an old man, but I have not done the work which God ſent me in to the world for to doe. I have read of an old Diſciple, who was 90 years of age, and being asked the queſtion, how old he was; he ſaid he was 45 years of age: they anſwered, your gray-haires diſcover
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170695:28"/>you to be much more: ſaith he, if that you reckon number of years, I have lived fourſcore and ten, but if I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute how long I have lived a devoted life to God, then I am but 45, for the other halfe of my time I lived a dead man. O how many are there in the world, that have lived as dead men, all their dayes! There is a paſſage in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.17.
<note place="margin">Ecleſ. 7.17</note> 
                     <hi>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou fooliſh, why ſhouldeſt thou die before thy time.</hi> Some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters carry it this way; A man walking in drunkeneſſe, exceſſe, and riot, doth, as it were, ſhorten his daies: Others, That he that thus lives is dead whilſt he lives, before his time of death, and when death comes he is twice dead. Indeed a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die before Gods time.
<note place="margin">Iob, 14.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 14.5. <hi>Seeing his dayes are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds, that hee cannot paſſe.</hi> Now though thou canſt not die before Gods time, yet thou maiſt die before thy time, that is,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170695:28"/>when thou comeſt to die before thou art prepared and fitted to die, before thou haſt done thy worke, thou art the man that doſt die before thy time. And that I take to be the meaning of thoſe words. O think of it; Though thou canſt not die before Gods time, yet thou maiſt die before thy time, before thou art fitted for death, before thou haſt done the worke for which God gave thee thy life. If Ieſus Chriſt did pray that his Diſciples might not die before they had done their work, then what blame are they worthy of, from whom (if they ſhould live till Doomes day) God ſhould have no more ſervice then now he hath; and in whom he ſhould then ſee as much ſin, as now he doth.</p>

                     </note> If it be ſo that Jeſus Chriſt doth not deſire, that his People ſhould be taken out of the world, untill they have don their work; Then all you that are Gods people, know that as long as God doth continue you here in the world,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170695:29"/>he hath work for you to doe: Suppoſe thou art thrown into Priſon, conſider that is a part of thy work thou muſt doe for Ieſus Chriſt: If thou art a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, and art under Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Repoach, or cruel Perſecution, for Righteouſneſſe ſake, conſider that this is part of the ſervice that thou art to do for God; Chriſt will not take you away when you have halfe your work for to doe, but when you have finiſhed your work, then you ſhall go for to receive your wages. I remember a ſaying of Mr <hi>Bolton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bolton.</note> when hee was on his Death-bed; ſaith hee, <hi>O Lord, this is my comfort, that though I have ended my dayes, yet I have done my worke, before I die.</hi> This is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table indeed to a godly heart, but dreadful to you that are wicked, who when you have ended your daies, have not begun your work, have not begun to ſerve your God. O this will be great gauling of Conſcience unto you ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther day; O this will be the worm that will gnaw upon you in hell to all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170695:29"/>eternity, to remember that God ſet you out your work for to do in this world, and vouchſafed you both time and meanes, for the accompliſhment of it; but you trifled away your time, ſinned away many heavenly opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of grace and mercy, played all the day long, when you had ſo much work for to doe: ſo that when your daies were at an end, you had not begun your work. As it was with <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi>

Thou flieſt to Chriſt, and laieſt hold on Chriſt, that is well done, but the ſtrength doth not lie here; Chriſt goes to his Father, and praies to his Father, and ſaith, Father keep ſuch a poore ſoule, that when he is tempted he may not yeeld, he may not fall.

                  </p>
                  <p>Having diſpatched the Cautions, I ſhall give the Reaſons why men muſt try the Doctrines that they hear:</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reaſon</hi> There is a neare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance betwixt er tonions, and true Teachers.</note> Becauſe erronious and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Teachers, may carry a very near reſemblance to them that preach the truth. I have read of two Painters <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> and <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> who contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the maſtery in that Art, the one painted Grapes ſo exactly, that the birds came to pick them, thinking they had been very Grapes: And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painted a Curtain ſo exactly, that his fellow Painter came to draw it, ſuppoſing that it had bin a real Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. There is ſuch a near affinitie betwixt ſound Teachers, and ſeducing Teachers, that it is no eaſie matter for a man to diſcern betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>But all is not gold that gliſters:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.13, 14.</note> A notable Text you have for this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14. <hi>For ſuch are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170695:50"/>no marvel, for Satan himſelfe is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angel of light.</hi> Falſe Apoſtles may transforme themſelves ſo, as to be like the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and Miniſters of the Devil, factors for hell, may transforme themſelves ſo as to be like the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that you ſhould try all Doctrines that you hear, whether they bee agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God, or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reaſon</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels that there ſhall be many falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> Becauſe the Word of God doth foretell that there ſhall be as many (if not more) falſe Teachers under the new Teſtament, then under the old, and more in the later daies, then were in the former ages of the world; this is plain from that Text of Scripture,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> They were of old under the Law, they ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170695:50"/>be with you under the Goſpel. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are dead, who corrupted the Law, yet the ſame Spirit ſtill lives in men, and will doe to the End of the World. The Apoſtle gives this, as a reaſon why we ſhould try ſuch Doctrines as we hear, becauſe in the times of the new Teſtament many falſe Teachers will appear, 1 John 4.1.
<note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Beleive not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> Believe not every man that ſaith he hath the Spirit, and that the Spirit doth teach him that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that he preacheth, but try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be agreable to the Word of God, or no; and the reaſon he gives is, becauſe there are many (not few) falſe Prophets, and thoſe not gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a corner, or bound up in one part of the World; indeed in former time, the neſt of them was encloſed in one part of the World, in <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> But now they are gone out into the whole
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170695:51"/>World: Therefore try the Spirits whether they be of God; try before ye truſt, before ye beleive.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reaſon</hi> Falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are publiſhed very craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily.</note> trie all Doctrines that you hear preached, becauſe falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Hereſies come from the publiſhers of them very ſlily and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily into the minds of men: There is not more legerdemain ſhewed by a cunning juggler, then by theſe falſe Teachers, they are ſubtile &amp; cunning to pervert the minds of men: As the Apoſtle ſhewes Epheſ. 4.14.
<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.14</note> 
                     <hi>That we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of Doctrin, by the ſtight of men, and cunning craftineſse whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> The word in the Greek is very emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe Teachers can as eaſily convey errors into the minds of men, as a cunning gamſter can cheat with a die. We have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170695:51"/>ſuch ſly, and ſubtile convayances, or elſe the truths of God could never have been perverted amongs us as they are. It is Obſervable, Rev. 9.8. That the <hi>locuſts that came out of the Eaſt,
<note place="margin">Rev. 9.8.</note> had their faces like the faces of women.</hi> Interpreters expound them to be <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and factors for <hi>Rome;</hi> they had womens faces, inſinuating and allureing countenances, invea gleing, enticeing, and bewitching of men with their follies. Of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Rom. 16.18. <hi>For they that are ſuch,
<note place="margin">Ro. 16.18.</note> ſerve not our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but their own bellies, and by good words, and fair ſpeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Even as a foul faced whore, painteth her face, ſo do they their damnable errors, with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſinuations; ſometimes they tickle itching ears with ſuch eloquent Notions as may make them admired. And ſometimes they ſuggeſt high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veledges, unſpeakable advantages by what they deliver; As the Devil did to our firſt parents, <hi>ye ſhall be like

By good words they deceive the hearts of the ſimple. And 2 Pet. 2.1. the Apoſtle ſets forth their flyneſſe in bringing in <hi>damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> Had <hi>Peter</hi> lived in our age, he would have been accounted a bitter man, to call them Hereſies, yea, and damnable Hereſies; but they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily brought in, and ſaith he, <hi>many ſhall follow their pernicious waies, and through covetouſneſſe ſhall they with feigned words make merchandiſe of you:</hi> with <hi>feigned words</hi> this muſt be done, under the ſpecious pretence of Truth, &amp; new Light; they will mix ſome gold with their copper, ſome truths with their falſehoods,
<note place="margin">Sunt mala miſta bonis, ſunt bona miſta malis.</note> they will ſweeten their baits, that they may take the ſooner.

                  <p>Fourthly,

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170695:61"/>Queſtions, that men enquire after in theſe daies: But this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the poor Jaylor here asked, is a Queſtion of the greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever can bee made by any man; It was no leſſe then this, what he might doe to be ſaved?</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion ſeems to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a man in great anguiſh, and conſternation of mind, and truly the matter the Queſtion is about, is ſuch as might trouble all the World: As a grave Divine anſwered one that came unto him, ſaying, Sir, I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about my Salvation; ſaith hee, freind it is a buſineſſe that might trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the World. So here this poor man cries out to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, what muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſpend time about the Explication, but ſhall diſpatch what I have to ſay, in a practical proſecution of theſe words. Before I come to the points of Doctrin I intend to handle; There are 3 concurrent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the words, from whence 3
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170695:61"/>Obſervations will ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the conſideration of the condition of the man that propounds this ſerious Queſtion, a <hi>Iaylor,</hi> a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in thoſe times eſpecially, full of infamy, becauſe the followers of Chriſt were moſt of all in bonds, when Oppreſſors, and men of violence eſcaped free; yet behold a <hi>Iaylor</hi> the object of pardoning mercy. Hence Obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſervation</hi> From the condition of the man that propounds this Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                     <hi>That men of the moſt deſpicable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the World,
may become the objects of Gods pardoning mercy.</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not impailed within the rank of the rich, and honourable of the World, but ſometimes men of the loweſt rank, become the objects of Gods mercy. Pardoning grace reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſometimes to the vildeſt, and moſt notorious ſinners in the World. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous,

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the conſideration of the occaſion or manner of this Jaylors converſion, for it is ſaid, <hi>In the night
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170695:62"/>there was a great Earth-quake in the priſon,</hi> and the Keeper awakened out of his ſleep, and when he aroſe, he ſaw all the priſon doores open, and think<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that all the priſoners had been gone, hee was in great perplexity of minde, ſearing what would befall him. Now God made this a means, to cauſe this man to look after Salvation, ſo that although he thought the eſcape of the priſoners might occaſion the loſſe of his life, yet his care now was, what he might doe to ſave his ſoule, he ſaid, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I doe to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſervation.</hi> from the occaſion of the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note>
                     <hi>That God by his providence,
doth many times ſo bring it about, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhall bee a means to make men look after Salvation.</hi> Had not this poor man thought that he had loſt his priſoners, God knowes whether hee had not loſt his ſoul, whether ever hee would have enquired after Salvation. I have read of a <hi>Scotiſh Divine,</hi> who being in a great fitt of ſickneſſe, did bleſſe God for it, for ſaith hee, this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170695:62"/>ſickneſſe of my body, hath been a means to ſave my ſoul. It is uſual with God to make afflictions of one kinde, or other, inſtrumental to make men enquire after Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The next thing to be conſidered is, the great alteration that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence made in the Jaylor. The poor man before was troubled to think that his priſon doors were opened, and it is ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>That hee drew his ſword, and would have killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> But now we finde no more talk of killing of himſelfe: But all his care was, how to ſave his ſoul: Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſervation.</hi> from the great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration that this providenc made in him.</note>
                     <hi>That when once men come to make a dilligent enquiry after Heaven,
there will then appear a great alteration in their paſſions, and affections.</hi> This mans fear, and care was not now, how to get his priſoners again; But his care now was, what he ſhould doe that he might no longer be a priſoner to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; not how to keep other men in bonds, but what hee ſhould doe to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170695:63"/>free himſelfe from the Devils bonds. Oh the wonderful change that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion workes in the ſoule! It doth not only change the converſation, but the very paſſions, and affections are changed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Obſervations are only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, and not directly intended in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall come to handle both the Enquirie that the Jaylor makes, and the Reſolve that the Apoſtle gives.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Jaylors Enquirie, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Queſtion,
<note place="margin">The Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ariſeth both from feare and hope.</note> or perplexed Quere, doth ariſe from a two-fold ſpring, or from two kinde of paſſions, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth ariſe from <hi>Feare.</hi> The man came in <hi>trembling</hi> and ſaid,
<note place="margin">from Fear</note> 
                     <hi>Sirs What ſhall I doe?</hi> Enquiries, when they are vehement, have mixtures of feare with them. As if hee ſhould have ſaid, I may looſe my life, and my ſoul too, oh but Sirs, tell me how I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170695:63"/>may ſave my ſoule, and then no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for my life. There was a mixture of fear in this Quere, what muſt I do by reaſon of the Evil I have done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It flowed from the affection of <hi>hope;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">from Hope</note> There would never have been Enquitie made, if there had not been ſome hopes of mercy. The Queſtion, what muſt I doe? argues ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hope: After impoſſibillities we make no Enquirie; wee make no Enquirie how wee may climbe up to Heaven, how we may fly like a bird in the aire, becauſe theſe things are not poſſible to be done. But the things that are attainable, are the objects of our Enquirie: Now, what muſt I do? argues that there was ſome hopes in this mans breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Text containes in it theſe two particulars;
<note place="margin">Two parts in the Text</note> 1. The Quere of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed ſoule, <hi>What muſt I doe to bee ſaved?</hi> 2. A full and ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170695:64"/>Now before I give you the point of Doctrine,
<note place="margin">6 Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from the form of ſpeech he uſed.</note> from the Jaylors Quaere, obſerve theſe ſix particulars about the manner and form of the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth not ſay, <hi>what evil ſhall I doe?</hi> he that had done ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil already, would not add ſin, to ſin: But he ſayth, what <hi>good</hi> ſhall I doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth not ſay, what <hi>good words ſhall I ſpeak?</hi> or <hi>what good profeſsion ſhall I make?</hi> But what <hi>good</hi> ſhall I <hi>doe.</hi> It is not good words, it is not a good profeſſion which will bring a man to Heaven: many cryed <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> that never entred into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not ſaid, <hi>what may I doe,</hi> as if it were indifferent whether he might do it, or no: But he ſaw there was a neceſſity of doing ſomewhat, <hi>what muſt I doe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not ſaid, <hi>what muſt another man doe?</hi> but what muſt <hi>I doe?</hi> As I cannot live by the food that another man ears, ſo I cannot go to Heaven by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170695:64"/>the grace which another man acts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not ſaid, what muſt I <hi>know?</hi> but, what muſt I <hi>doe?</hi> There are many times high flowen ſpeculations in mens minds, when there are no graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſitions in their hearts. But it is not knowing, but doeing that will bring a man to Heaven.
<note place="margin">Iohn 13.17</note> 
                     <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> The Devils know more then all the ſons of men; they know much good, but they doe much evil.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not ſaid, what muſt I doe <hi>to get my priſoners again?</hi> but, what muſt I doe <hi>to get to Heaven, to ſave my ſoul?</hi> And this indeed is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie, above all Enquirings. Thus you have ſome advertizements from the form of expreſſion here uſed by the Jaylor.</p>

                     </label> The Obſervation is this: <hi>viz.
That above all things in the World, this is the moſt needfull thing for the ſons of men to make Enquiry after, namely, what they muſt do to be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this propoſition,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170695:65"/>I ſhall firſt premiſe ſome Cautions, ſecondly, give you ſome Reaſons, and then Apply it.</p>
                  <p>The Cautions are three.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Caution</hi> No man is not ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Firſt, Though it be the moſt needfull thing in the World, for the ſons of men to make Enquirie after this, <hi>viz.</hi> what they muſt <hi>doe</hi> to be ſaved, yet take this Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That though we muſt Enquire what wee muſt doe, yet wee muſt not expect to be ſaved by doing. A full expreſſion to this purpoſe there is in Iob 7.20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou Preſerver of men?</hi> The interrogation implies an abſolute negation; what ſhall I doe? that is, I can doe nothing to ſatisfie thy juſtice, to pacifie thy wrath, or procure thy love, and favour; Lord I have greivouſly ſinned againſt thee, and if thou lookeſt for reparation and ſatisfaction at my hands, I am no way able to make it. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks like a poor forlorne, broken debter, to his rich and incenſed Creditor, areſting him for his debt, which he is no way able
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170695:65"/>to ſatisfy, and therefore hee throwes himſelfe at his feet, and cries out, Sir, I confeſſe, I owe you much, but I have nothing to pay, I am not able to make you the leaſt ſatisfaction, for what I owe you. Thus it is with all man kind ſince the fall of Adam, God intruſted Us with a great ſtock, but we have loſt all, and are become banckrupts deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted, we owe a thouſand times ten thouſand Tallents unto God; and of our ſelves are not able to make the leaſt ſatisfaction unto his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for all the wrong and diſhonour we have done unto him by our ſins; we may indeed doe ſomething to God as a payment of our duty, but we can do nothing as a payment of our debt which we owe unto him. Therefore though there muſt be Enquirie made, what muſt <hi>I doe</hi> to bee ſaved? yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that no man is ſaved <hi>for doeing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Caution</hi> no man is ſaved with out doing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though no man is ſaved <hi>for doeing,</hi> yet Enquiry muſt be made, what muſt I doe? becauſe no man can bee ſaved
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170695:66"/>
                     <hi>without doeing;</hi> according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Though God made thee without thy ſelfe, yet hee will not ſave thee without thy ſelfe.</hi> Indeed my doeing is not the cauſe of God's ſaving of me, but it is a cauſe without which God will not ſave me; God ſaves no man for his doeing, yet God will not ſave any man without his doeing: God is not ſo prodigall of Heaven, as to throw it into thoſe mens laps that will take no paines for it. Heaven is a Goal, and unleſſe you run you ſhall never obtain it: Heaven is a Crown of Life, but unleſſe you be faithfull to death, you ſhall never weare it.</p>
                  <p>A third Caution is this,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>Caution</hi> Heavenly care doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care</note> That En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after Salvation, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude lawfull Enquiry and care after worldly things: God did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Heaven ſhould ſo monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and impaile your care and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that you ſhould look after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heaven; you may have Heaven and the World too: You
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170695:66"/>need not doe as <hi>Socrates</hi> did,
<note place="margin">Socrates</note> who becauſe his Eſtate did hinder him from ſtudying <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> therefore he threw it all into the Sea, and ſaid, <hi>I will deſtroy thee, leſt thou ſhouldeſt deſtroy mee.</hi> You need not caſt away your Eſtate, you may make Enquirie after the things of the World and Heaven too; alwaies provided, that your firſt and chiefeſt care bee after Heaven, &amp; heavenly things, and your worldly care ſubordinate thereunto. Theſe are the Cautions.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſons of the point fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reaſon</hi> From the Soules ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</note> we ſhould above all things make Enquirie what wee muſt doe to be ſaved, becauſe the Soul is the moſt excellent thing in the World: it is clothed in Scripture with this Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite, the <hi>precious Soul.</hi> The Bodie is but the ſhell, the Soul is the Pearl; the Bodie is but the caſe, the Soul is the jewell: therfore make it thy great work, how to ſave thy Soul, becauſe it carries a greater excellencie with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170695:67"/>it, then all the world beſides. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was wont to ſay of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that he was negligent in things belonging to himſelfe, but diligent in things concerning the Commonwealth; So ſhould we be negligent in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Bodies in compariſon of things concerning our Soules.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reaſon</hi> Heavenly care is the leady way to bodily welfare</note> the Enquirie after the Soules ſafety, is the ready way to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure the welfare of the Bodie: There is no man is wiſe for himſelfe, if he be not wiſe for his Soul: <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33. <hi>But ſeek yee firſt the kingdom of God,
<note place="margin">Math. 6.33</note> and his Righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhallbe added unto you.</hi> Make it your great bargain, to buy Heaven, and God will caſt in the world as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and pack-thred, over and above; as Riches and Honour were given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 3.12</note> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.12. Indeed God will not alwaies give the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular temporall bleſſings that you crave, or think you ſtand in need of, for he knoweth what wee want better than we our ſelves; but though hee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170695:67"/>doth not alwaies heare us according to our will,
<note place="margin">Deus non ſemper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem vel volupta tem, ut eſmper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audiat ad ſalutem</note> yet he alwaies heares us according to our wants: for ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>godlineſſe hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life conditionally, ſo far as they conduce to our good; but of the life to come abſolutely. It is a notable paſſage that we read of <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.21. <hi>And it came to paſſe,
<note place="margin">Exod. 1.21</note> becauſe the Midwives feared God, that Hee made them houſes.</hi> The Midwives feared God, and God took care for them. Doe thou take care of thy Soul and God will take care of thy Body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 <hi>reaſon</hi> From the devils care to deſtroy the ſoul</note> make Enquirie to ſave thy Soul, becauſe there is ſo much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie made by the Devill to deſtroy thy Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be ſober and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> becauſe your adverſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill as a roaring Lion walketh about ſeeking whom hee may devour:</hi> in the originall it is, <hi>whom he may drink up at one draft.</hi> Satan envies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored condition, that we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170695:68"/>that Paradiſe of Bliſſe which once he had, and out of which he was caſt; and therefore it is that he is become our irreconcileable Enemie, and is continually tempting and diſturbing of us, out of his infinite hatred of God and goodneſſe: As the Leopard beareth ſuch a naturall hatred againſt men, that if he ſee but the picture of a man, he will tear it to pecces; ſo the Devill if he ſees but the image of God in us, by all meanes ſeeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us.
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt</note> Now <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the Devill doth watch, wilt thou ſleep?</hi> if the Devill doth goe about, wilt thou ſit ſtill? if the Devill doth make Enquirie what ſoules he may devoure and damn, why then ſhould not the ſonnes of men make it their work to enquire how to ſave their ſoules?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reaſon</hi> If thou Ioſeſt thy ſoule, thou loſeſt all</note> make this Enquirie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if thou loſeſt thy Soul, thou haſt the greateſt loſſe that is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is not a loſſe beyond it. To loſe the Soul, is to bid farewell to God, farewell to Chriſt, farewell to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170695:68"/>a Kingdom, and farewell to all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Saints and Angels, for ever and ever: O that word <hi>ever</hi> is the great aggravation of this loſſe: it is a loſſe not to be repaired. Loſe thy Soul, and thou loſeſt all; it is a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſſe, a loſſe that is irrecoverable. It is a good Obſervation that <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> hath, ſaith hee,
<note place="margin">Chryſost</note> 
                     <hi>Nature hath ſo ordered the parts of the body, that a man hath two eyes, two hands, two feet, and two eares; ſo that if a man doth loſe one eye, he can ſee with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or loſe one leg, hee can goe with the other; or loſe one hand, he can work with the other; or loſe one eare, he can heare with the other: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath given thee but one Soul, and if thou loſeſt that, thou loſeſt all.</hi> O that the conſideration hereof, would cauſe you to make this Enquiry, <hi>what muſt I doe to ſave my Soul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now come to make ſome Uſefull Application: If it be ſo,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>

<note place="margin">Firſt, thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire only after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Queſtions</note> but never make Enquirie a bout matters of Salvation.

                  <p>Firſt, Hath God taken thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods with your ſouls,

<note place="margin">1 Method that God takes.</note> ſo, as that he makes him ſee his ſins to be exceeding ſinful, and himſelfe to be exceeding miſerable;
<note place="margin">Iob 33.27, 28, 29.30.</note> you have an admirable Text for this, Job 33.27,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170695:71"/>29, 30. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any man ſay, I have ſinned, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which was right, and it profited me not; Hee will deliver his ſoul from going into the Pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light: Loe all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his ſoul from the Pit, to bee En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the light of the liveing.</hi> It is Gods uſual way in bringing a ſinner from Hell, to repreſent his ſins unto him in the glaſſe of the Law, ſo as to cauſe him to ſee them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful, to cauſe him to confeſſe his ſinfulneſſe, how that hee hath perverted that which was right. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he was alive without the Law, but when the Law came, then he ſaw his ſin to be exceeding ſinful.
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.13</note>

                  <p>A ſecond Method that God takes with a ſinner to ſave his ſoule, is this,
<note place="margin">2 method that God takes.</note> God puts him into a condition of Spiritual aſtoniſhment, ſo as to ſee himſelfe an undone creature, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unable to ſave himſelfe, neither doth hee know who will undertake that work for him; this is plain in the Text, <hi>Sirs, What muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi> a Queſtion full of aſtoniſhment and perplexity of mind.

                  <p>A third Method that God takes with a ſinner is this,

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170695:72"/>object in all the world.

Ye whoſe ſouls can bear you witneſſe, that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe very Methods with you, know for your comfort, that theſe are the very Methods that God doth take with that ſoule whom hee intends to ſave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 by the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Chriſt works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart.</note> You may diſcerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath brought you into an eſtate of Salvation, by thoſe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Jeſus Chriſt will work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of thoſe whom hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſave. Now theſe impreſſions are four-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 impreſſion upon the heart.</note> God doth cauſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and Majeſtie of the Word, at ſome time or other, to fall on the Conſcience of that man with great conviction,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18</note> whom he intends to ſave. 1 Cor. 1.18. <hi>For the preaching of the Croſſe is to them that periſh fooliſhneſſe, but unto us that are ſaved, it is the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170695:72"/>power of God.</hi> The power of God in his Word, ſhall be felt on the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that man, whom God brings into a ſaving eſtate: Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith expreſly 1 Theſ. 2.13.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.13.</note> 
                     <hi>For this cauſe alſo, thank wee God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us, yee received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> The Word of God hath an effectual Work, and Majeſtick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on them that ſhall bee Saved. It is mighty in operation in them that beleive, transforming them into the very image of it ſelfe; it workes what it preſcribes, it enables the ſoul to come up unto every duty, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo difficult to fleſh and blood, to hate every ſin, be it never ſo pleaſant, or profitable. It is Active,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> and Oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Sharper then a two-edged ſword, it effectually bindes the Conſcience, rectifies the Judgment, ſubdues the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170695:73"/>Will, the ſinner cannot ſtand out againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond impreſſion that God makes on the heart of that man who ſhall be ſaved,
<note place="margin">2 Impreſſion upon the heart.</note> is this, he is brought into an obediential frame to obey the Commands of God; the Law of God is not burdenſome but pleaſing, and delightful unto him, he hath a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reſpect unto all Gods Commands, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. And ſaith the Apoſtle Heb. 5.9. <hi>Being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he became the Author of Eternall Salvation unto all that obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God brings thee into a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition,
<note place="margin">3 Impreſſion upon the heart.</note> he makes this impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thy heart, that thou art become as induſtrious to have thy nature ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
<note place="margin">Titus 3.3.</note> as thy ſoul to be ſaved. Titus 3.3. <hi>Not by workes of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghaſt.</hi> And John 3.3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170695:73"/>The laſt impreſſion is this,

                        </gap> the heart.</note> If God ſaves thy ſoul, he will bring thee into a beleiveing eſtate, he will cauſe thee to lay hold on Chriſt by faith: And this leads me unto the ſecond point,
<note place="margin">Second part of the Text open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed.</note> which is the Reſolve that the Apoſtle gives to this poor man crying out, what hee ſhould doe to be ſaved, <hi>viz. Beleive on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the firſt bluſh one would think that the Apoſtles Reſolve ſhould no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all quiet the heart of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered man. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> bid the man <hi>beleive:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>To this I Anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſwer</hi> God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to give what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</note> Though it bee true, that every command of God is alike difficult to fleſh, and blood: A man can as well make a World, as make a prayer aright; A man can as well ſubdue an Army of men, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

Yet know for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that this is the tenure of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that when the Lord doth call for any thing at the hand of his Elect Children, he doth with that command convay a power into their ſouls to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to fullfill that command. If God bids a man beleive, and gives him power to beleive, the work will ſoon be done.
<note place="margin">Ezekel 36.</note> In the 36 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> the Lord commands to make a new heart; Now a man is no more able to make a new heart, then to make a new World: Therefore in the ſame place, he promiſes <hi>to give a new heart.</hi> And in another place it is ſaid,

If we put forth the ſanctifying abillities that God gives us, God will adde aſſiſting grace, to enable us to doe what of our ſelves we cannot doe.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170695:75"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> gives to this Queſtion, and the Reſolve that <hi>Peter</hi> gives to the ſame Queſtion in Acts 2.38.

Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> give this Anſwer, <hi>Beleive, and be Saved. Peter</hi> gives this Anſwer, <hi>Repent, and be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> There is much of Gods minde in this, that different anſwers, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Holy-ghoſt to one and the ſame Queſtion. Both their anſwers are true: <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Repent and be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> to ſhew that that Faith which is not joyned with Repentance, is but a preſumptuous confidence. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Beleive and be Saved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faith and Repentane muſt bee joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> to let you know that that Repentance, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Faith, is but a legal ſorrow. Therefore one ſaith <hi>beleive,</hi> the other ſaith <hi>repent,</hi> to ſhew that ye muſt joyn both together.

Now this I note the rather, becauſe there are ſome men that are all for beleiving on Jeſus Chriſt, and not at all for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and mourning for ſin. Theſe make <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer, to bee no anſwer at all. Then there are others, that are all for repentance, they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, and diſtreſſed in mind, they wiſh their heads were water, and their eyes a fountain of tears, they think by their ſorrow for ſin, to make an attonement with God; but they do not at all reſt on Jeſus Chriſt, by faith. Now theſe men make <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer, to be no anſwer at all. But remember you muſt <hi>Repent and be Saved,</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> and you muſt <hi>Beleive and be Saved</hi> with <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſhall only breifly ſpeak to the anſwer which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> here
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170695:76"/>give:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrin </seg>
                     </label> And from thence obſerve, <hi>That it is the duty of all thoſe that expect Salvation, to beleive in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But me thinks I hear ſome ſay, If this be ſo, ſurely then Salvation may be had on very eaſy terms; for, do not all beleive on Jeſus Chriſt. God forbid that any ſhould be ſo wicked, as not to beleive on their Saviour. I anſwer, Indeed there are many that have a kinde of beleife, an hiſtorical, noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, common dead faith, ſuch a faith as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had, as the ſtony ground had, as the Devils have who beleive and tremble. This faith a man may have, and goe to Hell.</p>
                  <p>But there are few in the World who have a lively precious unfained faith, which the Scripture doth indeed account beleiving in Chriſt, &amp; which whoſoever hath ſhall never periſh but have everlaſting life. Few there are that are willing to receive Chriſt as he is tendred in the Goſpel, to receive Chriſt as a King to rule them, as well as a Jeſus to ſave them: Few that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170695:76"/>to receive a naked Chriſt, Chriſt with his Croſſe as well as Chriſt with his Crown: Few that are as ready to give up themſelves to Chriſt for Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, as to take Chriſt for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Moſt people love the Preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office of Chriſt, to purchaſe Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, but they doe not love the Kingly office of Chriſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Corruption in them; they would be willing to have Chriſt receive them into Heaven, but they are not willing to receive Chriſt into their hearts. In the day of their callamitie when they lie upon their ſick beds, and the terrours of death take hold upon them, then none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt: But in the day of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, when the World ſmiles upon them, and Riches &amp; Health ſurrounds them, then Chriſt is diſeſteemed by them, they ſee no beauty in him, why they ſhould deſire him. For there is no wicked man in the World will take Chriſt upon Goſpel tearms in the time of his health, and outward
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170695:77"/>proſperity. And moreover, moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think that it is the eaſieſt matter in the World, for to beleive, that it is <hi>but</hi> Beleiving, that it is in their power to beleive at any time, when they will, and that they can beleive time enough when they lie upon their Death-beds. Not conſidering, God puts forth the ſame almighty power when he workes faith in the ſoul, as he did when hee raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, as the Apoſtle ſhewes,
<note place="margin">1 Ephe. 19.20.</note> Eph. 1.19.20. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power to us-ward who beleive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> It is as impoſſible for a man, by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to make himſelfe to beleive, as to create a world, or give a being to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And here conſider, that every aſſent unto the Word is not beleiving; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed ſaith that beleiving is only a bare aſſent to the Word, but if ſaving faith did only conſiſt in a bare aſſent to Scripture truth, then
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170695:77"/>there would bee multitudes of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the World; but ſuch beleivers God will never own.</p>

And though for all this, his enemies would not acknowledge the Divinity of Chriſt, yet a certain young woman (as may be gathered from the hiſtory) came, and lifted up her voice, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb

<hi>Rather Bleſſed</hi> are they that hear <hi>my</hi> words, and <hi>my</hi> ſayings; it is ſo ſaid in ſome other places: but here it is ſaid, they that hear <hi>Gods Word.</hi> For had Chriſt ſaid, <hi>rather bleſſed</hi> are they that hear <hi>my</hi> word, then people might have thought that Chriſt did impute bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe only to his own preaching, and to thoſe that heard him perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach. Therefore Chriſt faith, <hi>rather bleſſed</hi> are they that heare <hi>Gods Word,</hi> be it preached by <hi>Peter,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170695:87"/>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo;</hi> by any Diſciples, now living, or by any Miniſter of the Goſpel that ſhall live afterwards to the Worlds end. Whoſoever ſhall heare the Word of God contained in the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, and keep it, they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſſed then my mother was, if ſhee be conſidered only, as inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to the bringing of mee into the World. And in this expreſſion there is a ſecret Glory or Honour put upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, by Jeſus Chriſt, who would not limit the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his own preaching, but extends it to the Word of God in any Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mouth. And that is the reaſon (as many think) of that ſaying in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Hee that beleiveth ſhall doe greater workes then Chriſt did. It is not meant of the workes of Redemption, but of the miniſterial works; that a faithfull Miniſter ſhall convert more ſouls then Chriſt by his Miniſtry did convert. Chriſt indeed could have converted all that heard
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170695:87"/>him, but hee did it not, leſt men ſhould have thought that they muſt have heard none but Chriſt. We do not read of many that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſts preaching, there were more converted by <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Apoſtles, then by Chriſt himſelf; this Chriſt did that people might not diſpiſe any of his ordinary Miniſters. If Chriſt had converted more then all the Diſciples, people then would have ſlighted the Diſciples, and followed only Chriſt. This diſtemper began to grow in the Apoſtles daies. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12</note> 1.12. <hi>Now this I ſay, That every one of you ſaith; I am of paul, I am of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, I am of Cephas, and I am of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle blames them that they ſhould ſay, I am of Chriſt. The meaning is not, as though men were blame-wothy, for following, and loving of Chriſt, God forbid; it is our higheſt duty ſo to doe: But there were ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> who were ready to ſay, I care not for hearing of <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> but I am
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170695:88"/>only for hearing of Jeſus Chriſt. This was a vain, and ſinfull crying up of Chriſt. Thus for men to cry up Chriſt, to preach Chriſt, and in the mean time to cry down the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, this is ſinfull, and Chriſt will never own this to bee a preaching of him: For Chriſt faith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it,</hi> Let it bee preached by any faithfull Miniſter whatſoever.</p>

<note place="margin">2 A keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word in our practis</note> There is a keeping of the Word in your practice; and that is done when there is a conſcionable eare to ſquare your lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, anſwerable to what you hear, or know.

                  <p>It is worthy your notice, what a different Dialect is uſed by the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man in the Text, and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that was kinſwoman to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The woman in the Text faith, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps that thou haſt ſucked.</hi>

A man would think it unneceſſary to treat againſt the popiſh Doctrin, but Miniſters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had more reaſon for it, then now: for there never was more likelihood of popery its ſpreading then in theſe dayes, wherein under the notion of a curſed Toleration, Preiſts, and Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites do publiſh their blaſphemous, and idolatrous Tenents, and drive on their Jeſuitical Deſignes: and God knows, how ſoon you that will not lay your neck under Chriſts yoak, may be brought under the popiſh yoak.

Again for thy comfort know, that if in ſincerity of heart thou endeavoureſt to keep what thou heareſt, in divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is all one, as if thou hadſt perfectly kept all that thou heareſt. If it bee the deſire and labour of thy ſoul, to obay Gods Will, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Commands, in divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, it is looked upon, as if it were actually done by thee. It is worthy your notice, what is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and hee that had received the promiſe, offered up his only begotten Son.</hi> Abraham did not actually doe it: But becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> did it in the purpoſe of his heart, becauſe the deſire and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſoule was to obay Gods Command, therefore the Scripture accounts it as done.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words contain in them the happy cloſure and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of <hi>Stephens</hi> life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have three particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Perſon that fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Speech that he made when he fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What he did when he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Speech.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have the Perſon that fell aſleep, and that was <hi>Stephen:</hi> He was a man full of faith, and full of the Holy-Ghoſt, as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:170695:108"/>6.5. He was the firſt Martyr that ever ſuffered for the cauſe of Chriſt; hence I might gather this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the beſt of men are ſubject to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and unnatural deaths. Stephen</hi> that was full of the Holy Ghoſt, was ſtoned to death; and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt that was full of the Holy-Ghoſt from the very womb, was beheaded; <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified, and ſo was <hi>Andrew; I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> was ſawed aſunder; <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was ſtoned, and <hi>Zacharias</hi> was ſlain between the Temple and the Altar. But I ſhall paſſe this.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Text, is the Speech that <hi>Stephen</hi> made when hee fell aſleep, <hi>Hoc dicto obdormivit,</hi> that is, when hee had finiſhed his prayer, <hi>He fell aſleep.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is an excellent way to cloſe up our lips with prayer.</hi> To die praying is a moſt Chriſtian way of dying. <hi>They ſtoned Stephen calling upon God.</hi> After this manner Chriſt died, hee prayed, <hi>Father into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit, and having thus ſaid
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170695:108"/>he gave up the ghoſt.</hi> This he did that it might be a patern to all Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is a neceſſary duty at all times, but eſpecially when we are ady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that for theſe three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe when we are to die, we have moſt need of Gods help, for then the Devil is moſt buſie, and we moſt weak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe when we are to die, wee are to beg the greateſt boon of God, that is, that he would receive us into his heavenly Kingdom. Now prayer is the chiefe means to obtain this mercy, for it is <hi>Porta Coeli, Clavis Paradiſi,</hi> the Gate of Heaven, a Key to let us into Paradiſe. Therefore we have great reaſon to die praying.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe when a Saint of God is dying, he is then to take his laſt fare well of prayer. In Heaven there is no praying, but all thankſgiving; there is no need in Heaven, therefore no prayer in Heaven. Now a Saint of God, being to take his leave of prayer, when he is to die, therefore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170695:109"/>it is fit he ſhould die praying.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you remember this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the Text, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Stephen</hi> died cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord. Let us die pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that Emper or ſaid, <hi>Oportet Imperatorem ſtantem mori:</hi> ſo may I ſay, <hi>Oportet Chriſtianum mort praecan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> it behoves a Chriſtian to die praying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what was the ſubſtance of <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He prayed for himſelfe, and he prayed for his perſecutors.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 He prayed for himſelfe, <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> verſe 59.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hee prayed for his perſecutors, <hi>Lord lay not this to their charge,</hi> v. 60.</p>
                  <p>I will not enter upon this part of the Text, for it would ſwallow up all my time. Therefore I ſhall wave it, and come to the third part, which is that which (by Gods aſſiſtance) I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſpeak unto, <hi>viz.</hi> What <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> did, when hee had finiſhed his prayer. <hi>When he had ſayd this, he fell aſleep,</hi> that is, he died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170695:109"/>Behold here, the magnanimity, the piety, and the Chriſtian courage of <hi>Stephen.</hi> The people were ſtoning of him, and gnaſhing their teeth upon. him, and the good man dies with as much quietneſſe of minde, as if he had died in his bed; <hi>he fell aſleep,</hi> while they were ſtoning of him. When he died, he prayed, and while he prayed he died.</p>
                  <p>But what made <hi>Stephen</hi> die thus quietly? Read the 55 verſe, and you ſhall ſee the reaſon of it: <hi>Being full of the Holy Ghoſt, he looked ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of God. Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opened, and the Son of man ſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God.</hi> This made him die with ſuch a ſweet, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and calm temper; he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God, ready to receive his Soul, and that made him die with ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary quietneſſe of minde.</p>
                  <p>Death in Scripture, (eſpecially the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170695:110"/>death of Gods children) is often compared to a ſleep. It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he ſlept with his fathers.</hi> And it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I would not have you ignorant concerning them which are aſleep;</hi> that is, concerning them which are dead. And 1 Cor. 11.30 <hi>For this cauſe many are weakly and ſickly among you, and many ſleep;</hi> that is, many die. This expreſſion is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical expreſſion, and will afford us many rare and precious inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons about Death. And therfore (the grace of God aſſiſting me) I deſire to ſpend the reſt of the time in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Metaphor.</p>

                     </label> The Obſervation is this,
viz. <hi>That when a child of God dies, though his death be never ſo unnaturall and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet it is nothing elſe but a falling aſleep:</hi> Or, The death of a child of God, though ſtoned to death, though burnt to aſhes, though it be never ſo violent &amp; unnaturall, is nothing elſe but a falling aſleep. <hi>When he had ſaid this, he fell aſleep.</hi>

                     <hi>Somnus eſt mortis imago,</hi> Sleep is the image of Death: There are many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reſemblances betwixt Sleep and Death, ſome of which I ſhall ſpeak to at this time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Sleep is common to all men; there is no man that can live without ſleep: a man may live long without meat, but no man can live long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep. So it is true of death, death is common to all, it is <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all men once to die:</hi> and therfore <hi>David</hi> ſaid, he was to go the way of all fleſh: <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mort, Omnibus eſt calcanda ſemel lethi via;</hi> All men muſt ſleep the ſleep of death, or elſe be changed, which is a metaphoricall death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As ſleep ariſeth from the vapors that aſcend from the ſtomack to the head, &amp; tie the ſences, &amp; hinder their operations; ſo death came into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden Fruit, and by the poiſonfull vapor of ſin, that brought death upon him, and all his poſterity. <hi>By one man ſin
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170695:111"/>entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. Had <hi>Adam</hi> never ſinned, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould never have died: but <hi>in illo die,</hi> ſaid God, <hi>in that day thou eateſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Sinne brings <hi>omnimodam mortem,</hi> all kindes of death; it brings death tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, death ſpirituall, and death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Now becauſe all men are poiſoned with the poiſon of ſin, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men muſt ſleep the ſleep of death; it is ſin that hath poiſoned all mankinde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 As a man when he goeth to ſleep puts off his clothes, and goeth naked into bed: ſo it is with us when wee come to die; <hi>We came naked into the world, and we muſt go naked out of the world:</hi> As we brought nothing with us into the world, ſo we muſt carry nothing with us out of the world: And therefore Death in Scripture is called nothing elſe but an <hi>uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. Death to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170695:111"/>a childe of God, is nothing elſe, but the putting off of his cloaths. The body of man is <hi>animae</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>&amp; veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> it is the ſouls cloathing; and death is nothing elſe but the uncloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul; it is juſt like a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed, &amp; putting off his cloaths; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> cals it, The <hi>putting off our earthly tabernacle,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.14. Our bodies are the ſouls tabernacle, and death is the putting off of this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, when we come to die, we ſhall be ſtript naked of three things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſhall be ſtript naked of all our worldly honour, riches, and greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhall be ſtript naked of our bodies. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which is above all, we ſhall be ſtript naked of our ſins. And that is the happineſſe of a childe of God, he ſhall put off, not only his mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the body of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the fourth place obſerve, As no man knoweth the time when hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170695:112"/>fals aſleep, a man fals aſleep before he is aware: So no man can tell the certain time when he muſt die. There is nothing ſo certain as that wee muſt die, nothing ſo uncertain as the time when we ſhall die; Death comes ſuddenly even as ſleep comes upon a man before he is aware.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Obſerve, As children and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, becauſe they do not know the benefit of ſleep, are very loth to go to ſleep, many times the mother is fain to whip the child to bed; even ſo it is with moſt of Gods people, becauſe they do not ſtudy the benefit of death, that death puts an end to all our miſeries and ſins, and opens a door to let us in unto everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that we ſhall never ſee God or Chriſt before we die; I ſay, becauſe Gods people do not ſtudy the benefit of death, therefore they are like to little children, loth to die, loth to go to bed. And therefore death is called <hi>The King of terrors.</hi> Death is terrible to many of Gods children,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170695:112"/>becauſe they are but infants in grace, and becauſe they do not know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of death.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Obſerve, As when a man is faſt aſleep he is free from cares, and free from troubles; Let it thunder (as it thundred not long ſince, as you know) yet a man that is faſt aſleep, while hee is aſleep hee hears it not; Let the houſe bee on fire, while the man is aſleep, he ſees it not, neither is be troubled at it. So it is with the death of Gods children, when Gods children ſleep the ſleep of death, they are free from the thunders of this world, they are free from all cares, from all troubles, they goe to their graves as to their beds, and reſt in quietneſs, and are not ſenſible of any troubles that are in the world, <hi>For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham knew us not, Iſa.</hi> 63.16. So 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt be gathered into thy grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil which I will bring upon this place.</hi> When a childe of God ſleeps the ſleep of death, hee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170695:113"/>doth not feel nor is he ſenſible of any of the calamities or ſad providences of God upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When a man goeth to ſleep, he goeth to ſleep but for a certain time, in the morning he awakes out of ſleep. So it is with the ſleep of death; and therefore death is called a ſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt all awake in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reſurrection. We are in the grave, as in our bed, and when the trumpet of God, and the voice of the Archangel ſhall ſound, wee ſhall all riſe out of our grave, as out of our beds. Death is but a ſleep for a certain time.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sleep is a great refreſhing to thoſe that are weary &amp; ſick, and when the ſick man awakes, he is more lively &amp; chearful then he was before he fell aſleep; and therefore ſleep is called <hi>Medicus laborum, redintegratio viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, recreator corporum,</hi> The great Phyſician of the ſick body, the redin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegration of mans ſpirits, the reviver of the weary body. And ſo it is with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170695:113"/>death, when Gods people awake out of the ſleep of death, they ſhall bee more active for God, then ever they were before; when you lie down in the grave, you lie down with mortal bodies; <hi>It is ſown a mortal body,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.42, 43.</note> but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t ſhall riſe up an immortal body; it is ſown in diſhonour, but it ſhall riſe up in honour it is ſown a natural body, but it ſhall riſe up a ſpiritual body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. As in the morning when wee ariſe out of our beds, we then put on our clothes. So in the morning of the reſurrection, wee ſhall put on a glorious body, like to the glorious body of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhall put on <hi>Stolam immortalitatis,</hi> the garment of immortality.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As no man when he layeth him down to ſleep, knoweth the direct time when he ſhall awake. So no man can tell when the reſurrection ſhall be. They do but cozen you, who ſay that the general reſurrection ſhall bee ſuch or ſuch a year; for, as no man can know the minute when he ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170695:114"/>out of his natural ſleep, no more can any man know when we ſhall ariſe from the ſleep of death.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. As it is a very eaſie thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake a man out of ſleep, it is but jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him, &amp; you wil quickly awake him. So it is with the ſleep of death, it is as eaſie for Jeſus Chriſt to awake us out of the ſleep of death, as it is for me, or you to awake a man out of ſleep in bed. <hi>Nemo noſtrûm tam facilè excitat dormientem de lecto, quàm Chriſtus jacentem in ſepulchro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12 As when a man ariſeth in the morning, though he hath ſlept many houres; nay, ſuppoſe he could ſleep twenty yeares together, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when hee awaketh, theſe twenty yeares will ſeem to bee but as one houre unto him. So it will be at the day of judgment, all thoſe that are in their graves, when they awake, it will be <hi>tanquam ſomnus unius horae,</hi> but as the ſleep of one houre unto them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Laſtly, and moſt eſpecially, As
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170695:114"/>ſleep ſeizeth only upon the body and outward ſenſes, but doth not ſeize upon the ſoul, the foul of man is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times moſt buſie when the man is aſleep; and God hath heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed moſt glorious things to his children in Dreams, when they have been aſleep: God appeared unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and many others in Dreams; the body ſleeps, but the ſoul wakes. So it is with the ſleep of Death, the body, that dies, but the ſoul doth not die. There are ſome men that are not afraid to teach you, That the ſoul ſleeps as well as the body, and that when the body dies and fals aſleep, the ſoul likewiſe continues in a dull Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy <hi>veternoſo ſomno correptus,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capable of joy nor ſorrow, untill the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, This is a very uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and a very falſe Doctrine. They endeavour to prove it from my Text, they ſay, That <hi>Stephen</hi> when he died fell aſleep; It is true in regard of his body, he fell aſleep, but his ſoul did
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170695:115"/>not fall a ſleep, that which was ſtoned fell aſleep, which was his body only; for when he was ſtoning, he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding ready to receive his ſoul into Heaven; <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>receive my ſpirit. Stephens</hi> ſoul could not be ſtoned, though his body was ſtoned. So when Jeſus Chriſt was crucified, his ſoul was not crucified, I mean, when his body was killed, his ſoul was not killed; indeed he did endure torments in his ſoul, which made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But yet his ſoul did not die. So when <hi>Stephen</hi> died, his ſoul went to Chriſt. It is true, when a childe of God dies, the ſoul goes to ſleep, How is that? The ſoul goes to ſleep in a Scripture ſenſe, that is, it goes to reſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom (O bleſſed ſleep!) it goes to reſt in the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, it goes into the armes of its Redeemer, it goes into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe, it goes to be alwayes preſent with the Lord. But take heed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170695:115"/>of that wicked opinion, to ſay, that the ſoul ſleeps, in an Anabaptiſtical ſenſe, that is, That itlies in a ſtrange kinde of Lethargy, neither dead, nor alive, neither capable of joy nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, untill the reſurrection. Though <hi>Stephens</hi> body fell aſleep, yet his ſoul did not fall aſleep, but immediatly went unto Jeſus Chriſt in heaven. Thus I have given the Explication of the words.</p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to make ſome Application of all unto our ſelves.</p>

If you would ſleep an happy ſleep at death, then you muſt labour <hi>to ſleep in leſus Chriſt;</hi> It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4 14. <hi>If we beleive
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170695:119"/>that Ieſus died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Ieſus, will God bring with him.</hi> What is it to ſleep in Jeſus? To ſleep in Jeſus, is to die in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſleep in Jeſus, is to die with an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, to die as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt united to him, as our head. For you muſt know, that the duſt of a Saint is part of that man who is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Jeſus Chriſt, and every believer when he ſleeps in the duſt, he ſleeps in Jeſus Chriſt, that is, he lies in the grave, and his duſt is part of Chriſt myſtical, and Chriſt as an head will raiſe it up, and cannot bee compleat without it. Now then, if ever you would ſleep an happy ſleep, labour to get a real intereſt in Chriſt, labour to live in Chriſt while you live. And then, when you fall aſleep, you ſhall be ſure to ſleep in Jeſus. There are many would have Chriſt to receive their ſouls at death, and that ſay with dying <hi>Stephen, Lord Ieſus receive my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> But if ever you would have Chriſt to receive your ſouls when you die, you
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170695:120"/>muſt be ſure to receive him into your ſouls whilſt you live; if ever you would have him to receive you into Heaven, you muſt receive him into your hearts. No man makes a will, but he ſaith, <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> I bequeath my ſoul unto Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer. But how doſt thou know that Jeſus Chriſt will accept of this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy? If thy ſoul hath not Chriſts Image upon it, if it be not regenerated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. Jeſus Chriſt will never own it; Thou maiſt bequeath it unto Chriſt, but the Devil will claim it; if thy ſoul hath the Devils image upon it, if it be a ſwiniſh, polluted, unbeleiving, unregenerate ſoul thou maiſt beſtow it upon God, but the Devil will recover it out of Gods hands, pardon this expreſſion, it is not mine, but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auſtins.</hi> Beloved, if ever you would reign with Chriſt when you die, he muſt reign in you whilſt you live: and if ever you would ſleep an happy ſleep, you muſt live in Jeſus that you may ſleep in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. In the ſecond place, If ever you would ſleep an happy ſleep at death, then you muſt take heed of overcharging
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170695:120"/>your ſelves with worldly cares. A man that is full of cares cannot ſleep, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when men would ſleep, they lay (as the Proverb is) all their cares under their pillow, they labour to ſhut all cares out of their minde: O take heed that you do not murder your ſouls by the cares of the world; Beloved, a man that eats out his heart with worldly cares, will never ſleep an happy ſleep, the cares of the world will choak all the good ſeed of the Word of God; and therefore, as men when they ſleep lay aſide all worldly thoughts; ſo if ever you would ſleep an happy ſleep, take heed of overmuch carking and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the things of this world; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what you have heard this day, and that will regulate and moderate all cares, <hi>Naked you came into the world, and naked you muſt goe out of the world;</hi> Why ſhould we take care for that wee know not who ſhall enjoy after us?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If ever you would ſleep an happy ſleep when you die, you muſt take heed of ſucking too much of the pleaſures of this life: A man that eats a full ſupper
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170695:121"/>will ſleep very diſquietly, therefore they that would ſleep quietly, uſe to eat but light ſuppers; for when a mans ſtomack is over-charged, it takes away his ſweet ſleep from him. So if ever you would ſleep a happy ſleep when you come to die, O take heed of ſucking too much of the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life; take heed of eating too large a meal of worldly delights, and of creature comforts; theſe worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will make the ſleep of death unquiet unto you. Oh let not <hi>Dalilah's</hi> lap de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſom! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Bathſheba's</hi> embraces, loſt the embraces of God, I mean the ſence of the embraces of God, the joy and comfort of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if ever you would ſleep a happy ſleep in death, then labor to work hard for Heaven while you live. O how delightful is ſleep to a weary man! when a man hath taken paines all the day, as the Traveller that hath travelled all the day, or the Ploughman that hath been at work all the day, how quietly, how ſoundly doth he ſleep in the night! O beloved, if
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170695:121"/>if ever you would ſleep a happy ſleep at death, then labor to work out your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, and give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure: the more you labor for Heaven, the better, the ſweeter will your sleep be when you come to die. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that as much ſleeping in the day time, wil hinder a mans ſleep at night, ſo you that idle away the time of your providing for Heaven in this your day, you that sleep away the minute upon which Eternity doth depend, oh you will have a ſad sleep when Death ſeizeth upon you. Take heed therfore of sleeping while you live, that ſo your sleep in the night of death may be comfortable unto you.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly and laſtly, if ever you would sleep a happie sleep when you die, then take heed of the sleep of ſin. Sin in Scripture is compared to a sleep, <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> that is, thou that ſinneſt. Sinne is ſuch a sleep as brings the sleep of death; ſin brings the firſt death, and ſin brings the ſecond death: all miſeries whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are the daughters of ſin. If you would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170695:122"/>sleep a happy sleep, and have a happie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, at the Reſurrection, then take heed of the sleep of ſin. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead, and Ieſus Chriſt ſhall give thee life,</hi> Epheſ. 5.14. So Rom. 13.11, 12, 13. with which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and I pray you mark it well, for it was a Text that converted Saint <hi>Auguſtin, Knowing the time, Beloved, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep, for now is our ſalvation nearer then when we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſſe, and let us put on the armour of light; Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſſe, not in ſtrife and envying; but put you on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and make no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof.</hi>
